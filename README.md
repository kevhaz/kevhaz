- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kevhaz

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many practical home based manufacturing and delvelopment processes including:
- HomeAutomation
-   I've scratch built and coded home automation tools like:
-     A LORA Based Garrage Door sensor and controller (LORA has the link-budget capable of operating in RF difficult environments such as underground garages).
-     Remote Vivarium sensor.
-     Universal IR remote so I can control my legacy IR contoled devices using home automation (and therefore voice activation)
-     All devices were typically built around the ESP32 Microcontrol, and programmed in C++ using the Arduino SDK.
-     Room Environmment Monitring Device.
-  Fusion 360
-    For designing all sorts of useful home gadgets, widgets, boxes and replacment parts. I've also used it to design furniture, and tools to aid Ornamental Turning
-    I also used Fusion 360 to generate toolpaths for my home built MPCNC (Mostly "3D" printed CNC machine)
-  3D Printing
-    I make use of this extensively. My current project is usibg it for prototyping addition tooling for my MDF Rose Engine (Ornamental Turing Lathe)
-  Machining
-    My home workshop consists of
-      MyFord Super 7 Lathe
-      Zyto Mini Engineering Lathe
-      Mini Mill
-      Kuhlmann Pantograph
-      Douglas Shaper
-      Wood Turning Lathe
-      MDF Rose Engine
-      + other common Woodworking tools.
